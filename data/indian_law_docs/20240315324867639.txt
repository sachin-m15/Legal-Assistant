LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT 
Dated the 15" March, 2024 
D.O. No. 33022/1/2024-ILDR 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
As you are aware, the Government of India set up the Institute of Legislative 
Drafting and Research (ILDR) 
as 
a wing of the Legislative Department 
of the 
Ministry of Law and Justice in January, 1989 with the objective of giving training to 
the Central/State Government officers so as to build capacity in the field of legislative 
drafting. Since then, the ILDR has been imparting training in legislative drafting to 
such officers and has so far conducted Twenty-eighth Basic Courses in Legislative 
Drafting. 
2. 
ILDR 
is now organising the Thirty-fourth Basic Course 
in Legislative 
Drafting from 29 July, 2024 to 25" October, 2024. 
This Course 
is 
of three 
months’ duration and will cover both theoretical aspects of legislative drafting as well 
as on-the-job practical training. The said Course is meant for providing training to the 
officers of the State government/Union territory Administrations, State Government 
Undertakings, Statutory Authorities, attached and subordinate offices 
of the State 
Government, whose services are being utilised or likely to be utilised in drafting of 
laws, rules, regulations, bye-laws, etc. 
You are requested to nominate two suitable 
officers for the Basic Course. 
The officers who have already undergone training at 
ILDR during any previous year may not be nominated again. 
3. 
As per the policy laid down by the Government of India, officers belonging to 
the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes are to be 
given extensive training connected with their work. It is, therefore, requested that the 
officers belonging 
to these communities may 
be given due consideration while 
making nominations for the said Basic Course. You are also requested to give due 
opportunity to women officers. 
4. 
During the period of training, the officers will continue to be on the strength of 
the 
State Government/Union 
territory Administration 
and 
will 
receive pay 
and 
allowances from the concerned State Government/Union territory Administration and 
as such no expenditure on this account shall be borne by the Central Government. The 
trainees will be under the administrative control of the ILDR with regard to their 
leave.

5. 
It may please be noted that the ILDR has no arrangements for stay of the 
trainee officers in Delhi. As the training will last for three months, it is necessary in 
the interest of officers of the State Government/Union territory Administrations that 
the concerned Government/Administration may make suitable arrangements for their 
accommodation or by way of suitable special allowance so that they do not face any 
difficulty on this account. Further, it is expected that the trainee officers would not be 
called back before the completion of the training. 
6. 
As a part of the training programme, the trainee officers shall be taken for a 
study tour to States/Union territories outside Delhi so as to acquaint themselves of the 
legislative practices and procedures followed there. However, the travel and other 
expenses 
in respect of each candidate are required 
to be met by the concerned 
Government/Administration. 
Therefore, 
the 
State 
Government/Union 
territory 
Administration are requested to provide funds/advance to the nominated officers each 
to the tune of Rs. 35,000/ (Thirty five thousand rupees only) for study tour. 
7. 
The nomination of the officers may be sent in the proforma annexed hereto at 
an early date, so as to reach this Department not later than 21 June, 2024. 
With regards. 
Yours sincerely,
