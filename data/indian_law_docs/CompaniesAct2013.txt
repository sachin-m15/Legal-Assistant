324. Debts of all descriptions to be admitted to proof.— In every winding up (subject, in the case 
of insolvent companies, to the application in accordance with the provisions of this Act or of the law of 
insolvency), all debts payable on a contingency, and all claims against the company, present or future, 
certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages, shall be admissible to proof against the

certain value. 
 
 
183 
 
325. Application of insolvency rules in winding up of insolvent companies.— (1) In the winding 
up of an insolvent company, the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to—

(b) the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities; and 
(c) the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors, 
as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons 
adjudged insolvent: 
Provided that the security of every secured creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu 
charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen‘s portion therein, and, where a secured 
creditor, instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debts, opts to realise his security,— 
(i) the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge; 
(ii) any amount realised by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge shall be applied 
rateably for the discharge of workmen‘s dues; and 
(iii) so much of the debts due to such secured creditor as could not be realised by him or the 
amount of the workmen‘s portion in his security, whichever is less, shallrank pari passu with the 
workmen‘s dues for the purposes of section 326. 
(2) All persons under sub-section (1) shall be entitled to prove and receive dividends out of the assets 
of the company under winding up, and make such claims against the company as they respectively are 
entitled to make by virtue of this section: 
Provided that if a secured creditor, instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debts, 
proceeds to realise his security, he shall be liable to pay his portion of the expenses incurred by the 
liquidator, including a provisional liquidator, if any, for the preservation of the security before its 
realisation by the secured creditor. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, the portion of expenses incurred by the liquidator 
for the preservation of a security which the secured creditor shall be liable to pay shall be the whole of the 
expenses less an amount which bears to such expenses the same proportion as the workmen‘s portion in 
relation to the security bears to the value of the security. 
(3) For the purposes of this section, section 326 and section 327,— 
(a) ―workmen‘‘, in relation to a company, means the employees of the company, being workmen 
within the meaning of clause (s) of section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947); 
(b) ―workmen‘s dues‘‘, in relation to a company, means the aggregate of the following sums due 
from the company to its workmen, namely:— 
(i) all wages or salary including wages payable for time or piece work and salary earned 
wholly or in part by way of commission of any workman in respect of services rendered to the 
company and any compensation payable to any workman under any of the provisions of the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947); 
(ii) all accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any workman or, in the case of his 
death, to any other person in his right on the termination of his employment before or by the 
effect of the winding up order or resolution; 
(iii) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the purposes of 
reconstruction or amalgamation with another company or unless the company has, at the 
commencement of the winding up, under such a contract with insurers as is mentioned in section 
14 of the Workmen‘s Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923), rights capable of being transferred to 
and vested in the workmen, all amount due in respect of any compensation or liability for 
compensation under the said Act in respect of the death or disablement of any workman of the 
company; 
184 
 
(iv) all sums due to any workman from the provident fund, the pension fund, the gratuity fund 
or any other fund for the welfare of the workmen, maintained by the company; 
(c) ―workmen‘s portion‘‘, in relation to the security of any secured creditor of a company, means 
the amount which bears to the value of the security the same proportion as the amount of the 
workmen‘s dues bears to the aggregate of the amount of workmen‘s dues and the amount of the debts 
due to the secured creditors. 
Illustration 
The value of the security of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1,00,000. The total amount of the 
workmen‘s dues is Rs. 1,00,000. The amount of the debts due from the company to its secured creditors is 
Rs. 3,00,000. The aggregate of the amount of workmen‘s dues and the amount of debts due to secured 
creditors is Rs. 4,00,000. The workmen‘s portion of the security is, therefore, one-fourth of the value of 
the security, that is Rs. 25,000. 
326. Overriding preferential payments.— (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or 
any other law for the time being in force, in the winding up of a company,— 
(a) workmen‘s dues; and 
(b) debts due to secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause (iii) of the proviso to 
sub-section (1) of section 325 pari passu with such dues, 
shall be paid in priority to all other debts: 
Provided that in case of the winding up of a company, the sums towards wages or salary referred to in 
sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 325, which are payable for a period of two years 
preceding the winding up order or such other period as may be prescribed, shall be paid in priority to all 
other debts (including debts due to secured creditors), within a period of thirty days of sale of assets and 
shall be subject to such charge over the security of secured creditors as may be prescribed. 
(2) The debts payable under the proviso to sub-section (1) shall be paid in full before any payment is 
made to secured creditors and thereafter debts payable under that sub-section shall be paid in full, unless 
the assets are insufficient to meet them, in which case they shall abate in equal proportions. 
327. Preferential payments.— (1) In a winding up, subject to the provisions of section 326, there 
shall be paid in priority to all other debts,— 
(a) all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due from the company to the Central Government or a 
State Government or to a local authority at the relevant date, and having become due and payable 
within the twelve months immediately before that date; 
(b) all wages or salary including wages payable for time or piece work and salary earned wholly 
or in part by way of commission of any employee in respect of services rendered to the company and 
due for a period not exceeding four months within the twelve months immediately before the relevant 
date, subject to the condition that the amount payable under this clause to any workman shall not 
exceed such amount as may be notified; 
(c) all accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any employee, or in the case of his 
death, to any other person claiming under him, on the termination of his employment before, or by the 
winding up order, or, as the case may be, the dissolution of the company; 
(d) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the purposes of reconstruction 
or amalgamation with another company, all amount due in respect of contributions payable during the 
period of twelve months immediately before the relevant date by the company as the employer of 
persons under the Employees‘ State Insurance Act, 1948 (34 of 1948) or any other law for the time 
being in force; 
(e) unless the company has, at the commencement of winding up, under such a contract with any 
insurer as is mentioned in section 14 of the Workmen‘s Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923), rights 
capable of being transferred to and vested in the workmen, all amount due in respect of any 
185 
 
compensation or liability for compensation under the said Act in respect of the death or disablement 
of any employee of the company: 
Provided that where any compensation under the said Act is a weekly payment, the amount 
payable under this clause shall be taken to be the amount of the lump sum for which such weekly 
payment could, if redeemable, be redeemed, if the employer has made an application under that Act; 
(f) all sums due to any employee from the provident fund, the pension fund, the gratuity fund or 
any other fund for the welfare of the employees, maintained by the company; and 
(g) the expenses of any investigation held in pursuance of sections 213 and 216, in so far as they 
are payable by the company. 
(2) Where any payment has been made to any employee of a company on account of wages or salary 
or accrued holiday remuneration, himself or, in the case of his death, to any other person claiming through 
him, out of money advanced by some person for that purpose, the person by whom the money was 
advanced shall, in a winding up, have a right of priority in respect of the money so advanced and paid-up 
to the amount by which the sum in respect of which the employee or other person in his right would have 
been entitled to priority in the winding up has been reduced by reason of the payment having been made. 
(3) The debts enumerated in this section shall— 
(a) rank equally among themselves and be paid in full, unless the assets are insufficient to meet 
them, in which case they shall abate in equal proportions; and 
(b) so far as the assets of the company available for payment to general creditors are insufficient 
to meet them, have priority over the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge created 
by the company, and be paid accordingly out of any property comprised in or subject to that charge. 
(4) Subject to the retention of such sums as may be necessary for the costs and expenses of the 
winding up, the debts under this section shall be discharged forthwith so far as the assets are sufficient to 
meet them, and in the case of the debts to which priority is given under clause (d) of sub-section (1), 
formal proof thereof shall not be required except in so far as may be otherwise prescribed. 
(5) In the event of a landlord or other person distraining or having distrained on any goods or effects 
of the company within three months immediately before the date of a winding up order, the debts to 
which priority is given under this section shall be a first charge on the goods or effects so distrained on or 
the proceeds of the sale thereof: 
Provided that, in respect of any money paid under any such charge, the landlord or other person shall 
have the same rights of priority as the person to whom the payment is made. 
(6) Any remuneration in respect of a period of holiday or of absence from work on medical grounds 
through sickness or other good cause shall be deemed to be wages in respect of services rendered to the 
company during that period. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section,— 
(a) the expression ―accrued holiday remuneration‖ includes, in relation to any person, all sums 
which, by virtue either of his contract of employment or of any enactment including any order made 
or direction given thereunder, are payable on account of the remuneration which would, in the 
ordinary course, have become payable to him in respect of a period of holiday, had his employment 
with the company continued until he became entitled to be allowed the holiday; 
(b) the expression ―employee‖ does not include a workman; and 
(c) the expression ―relevant date‖ means— 
(i) in the case of a company being wound up by the Tribunal, the date of appointment or first 
appointment of a provisional liquidator, or if no such appointment was made, the date of the 
winding up order, unless, in either case, the company had commenced to be wound up voluntarily 
before that date; and 
186 
 
(ii) in any other case, the date of the passing of the resolution for the voluntary winding up of 
the company. 
328. Fraudulent preference.— (1) Where a company has given preference to a person who is one of 
the creditors of the company or a surety or guarantor for any of the debts or other liabilities of the 
company, and the company does anything or suffers anything done which has the effect of putting that 
person into a position which, in the event of the company going into liquidation, will be better than the 
position he would have been in if that thing had not been done prior to six months of making winding up 
application, the Tribunal, if satisfied that, such transaction is a fraudulent preference may order as it may 
think fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that 
preference. 
(2) If the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a preference transfer of property, movable or immovable, 
or any delivery of goods, payment, execution made, taken or done by or against a company within six 
months before making winding up application, the Tribunal may order as it may think fit and may declare 
such transaction invalid and restore the position. 
329. Transfers not in good faith to be void.— Any transfer of property, movable or immovable, or 
any delivery of goods, made by a company, not being a transfer or delivery made in the ordinary course 
of its business or in favour of a purchaser or encumbrance in good faith and for valuable consideration, if 
made within a period of one year before the presentation of a petition for winding up by the Tribunal or 
the passing of a resolution for voluntary winding up of the company, shall be void against the Company 
Liquidator. 
330. Certain transfers to be void.— Any transfer or assignment by a company of all its properties or 
assets to trustees for the benefit of all its creditors shall be void. 
331. Liabilities and rights of certain persons fraudulently preferred.— (1) Where a company is 
being wound up and anything made, taken or done after the commencement of this Act is invalid under 
section 328 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property mortgaged or charged to secure 
the company‘s debt, then, without prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising, apart from this provision, 
the person preferred shall be subject to the same liabilities, and shall have the same rights, as if he had 
undertaken to be personally liable as a surety for the debt, to the extent of the mortgage or charge on the 
property or the value of his interest, whichever is less. 
(2) The value of the interest of the person preferred under sub-section (1) shall be determined as at the 
date of the transaction constituting the fraudulent preference, as if the interest were free of all 
encumbrances other than those to which the mortgage or charge for the debt of the company was then 
subject. 
(3) On an application made to the Tribunal with respect to any payment on the ground that the 
payment was a fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to 
determine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment 
was made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereof, notwithstanding that it is not 
necessary so to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose, may give leave to bring in the 
surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of a suit for the recovery of the sum paid. 
(4) The provisions of sub-section (3) shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to transactions other 
than payment of money.

thereof being bound either to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of 
money; or 
(d) unprofitable contracts, 
the Company Liquidator may, notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of 
the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto or done anything in pursuance of the 
contract, with the leave of the Tribunal and subject to the provisions of this section, by writing signed by 
him, at any time within twelve months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended 
period as may be allowed by the Tribunal, disclaim the property: 
Provided that where the Company Liquidator had not become aware of the existence of any such 
property within one month from the commencement of the winding up, the power of disclaiming the 
property may be exercised at any time within twelve months after he has become aware thereof or such 
extended period as may be allowed by the Tribunal. 
(2) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest and 
liabilities of the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is 
necessary for the purpose of releasing the company and the property of the company from liability, affect 
the rights, interest or liabilities of any other person. 
(3) The Tribunal, before or on granting leave to disclaim, may require such notices to be given to 
persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make such other order in 
the matter as the Tribunal considers just and proper. 
(4) The Company Liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim any property in any case where an 
application in writing has been made to him by any person interested in the property requiring him to 
decide whether he will or will not disclaim and the Company Liquidator has not, within a period of 
twenty-eight days after the receipt of the application or such extended period as may be allowed by the 
Tribunal, give notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Tribunal for leave to disclaim, and in 
case the property is under a contract, if the Company Liquidator after such an application as aforesaid 
does not within the said period or extended period disclaim the contract, he shall be deemed to have 
adopted it. 
(5) The Tribunal may, on the application of any person who is, as against the Company Liquidator, 
entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the company, make an order 
rescinding the contract on such terms as to payment by or to either party of damages for the non-
performance of the contract, or otherwise as the Tribunal considers just and proper, and any damages 
payable under the order to any such person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding up. 
(6) The Tribunal may, on an application by any person who either claims any interest in any 
disclaimed property or is under any liability not discharged under this Act in respect of any disclaimed 
property, and after hearing any such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property 
in, or the delivery of the property to, any person entitled thereto or to whom it may seem just that the 
property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, 
and on such terms as the Tribunal considers just and proper, and on any such vesting order being made, 
the property comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person named therein in that behalf without 
any conveyance or assignment for the purpose: 
 
 
188 
 
Provided that where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Tribunal shall not make a 
vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company, whether as under-lessee or as 
mortgagee or holder of a charge by way of demise, except upon the terms of making that person— 
(a) subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company was subject 
under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up; or 
(b) if the Tribunal thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had 
been assigned to that person at that date, 
and in either event as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order, and any 
mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all 
interest in, and security upon the property, and, if there is no person claiming under the company who is 
willing to accept an order upon such terms, the Tribunal shall have power to vest the estate and interest of 
the company in the property in any person liable, either personally or in a representative character, and 
either alone or jointly with the company, to perform the covenants of the lessee in the lease, free and 
discharged from all estates, encumbrances and interests created therein by the company. 
(7) Any person affected by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a 
creditor of the company to the amount of the compensation or damages payable in respect of such effect, 
and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding up. 
334. Transfers, etc., after commencement of winding up to be void.— (1) In the case of a 
voluntary winding up, any transfer of shares in the company, not being a transfer made to or with the 
sanction of the Company Liquidator, and any alteration in the status of the members of the company, 
made after the commencement of the winding up, shall be void. 
(2) In the case of a winding up by the Tribunal, any disposition of the property, including actionable 
claims, of the company, and any transfer of shares in the company or alteration in the status of its 
members, made after the commencement of the winding up, shall, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, 
be void.

ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF A COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES 
Interpretation 
I. (1) In these regulations— 
(a) ―the Act‖ means the Companies Act, 2013, 
(b) ―the seal‖ means the common seal of the company. 
(2) Unless the context otherwise requires, words or expressions contained in these regulations shall 
bear the same meaning as in the Act or any statutory modification thereof in force at the date at which 
these regulations become binding on the company. 
Share capital and variation of rights 
II. 1. Subject to the provisions of the Act and these Articles, the shares in the capital of the company 
shall be under the control of the Directors who may issue, allot or otherwise dispose of the same or any of 
them to such persons, in such proportion and on such terms and conditions and either at a premium or at 
par and at such time as they may from time to time think fit. 
2. (i) Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall be entitled to 
receive within two months after incorporation, in case of subscribers to the memorandum or after 
allotment or within one month after the application for the registration of transfer or transmission or 
within such other period as the conditions of issue shall be provided,— 
(a) one certificate for all his shares without payment of any charges; or 
(b) several certificates, each for one or more of his shares, upon payment of twenty rupees for 
each certificate after the first. 
(ii) Every certificate shall be under the seal and shall specify the shares to which it relates and the 
amount paid-up thereon. 
(iii) In respect of any share or shares held jointly by several persons, the company shall not be bound 
to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a share to one of several joint holders 
shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders. 
3. (i) If any share certificate be worn out, defaced, mutilated or torn or if there be no further space on 
the back for endorsement of transfer, then upon production and surrender thereof to the company, a new 
certificate may be issued in lieu thereof, and if any certificate is lost or destroyed then upon proof thereof 
to the satisfaction of the company and on execution of such indemnity as the company deem adequate, a 
new certificate in lieu thereof shall be given. Every certificate under this Article shall be issued on 
payment of twenty rupees for each certificate. 
(ii) The provisions of Articles (2) and (3) shall mutatis mutandis apply to debentures of the company. 
4. Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share 
upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by, or be compelled in any way to recognise (even 
when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share, or any 
interest in any fractional part of a share, or (except only as by these regulations or by law otherwise 
provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the 
registered holder. 
5. (i) The company may exercise the powers of paying commissions conferred by sub-section (6) of 
section 40, provided that the rate per cent. or the amount of the commission paid or agreed to be paid shall 
be disclosed in the manner required by that section and rules made thereunder. 
(ii) The rate or amount of the commission shall not exceed the rate or amount prescribed in rules 
made under sub-section (6) of section 40. 
(iii) The commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully or partly paid 
shares or partly in the one way and partly in the other. 
238 
 
6. (i) If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to 
any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, subject to the 
provisions of section 48, and whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent 
in writing of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. 
(ii) To every such separate meeting, the provisions of these regulations relating to general meetings 
shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be at least two persons holding at 
least one-third of the issued shares of the class in question. 
7. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other 
rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be 
deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith. 
8. Subject to the provisions of section 55, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary 
resolution, be issued on the terms that they are to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as the 
company before the issue of the shares may, by special resolution, determine. 
Lien 
9. (i) The company shall have a first and paramount lien— 
(a) on every share (not being a fully paid share), for all monies (whether presently payable or not) 
called, or payable at a fixed time, in respect of that share; and 
(b) on all shares (not being fully paid shares) standing registered in the name of a single person, 
for all monies presently payable by him or his estate to the company: 
Provided that the Board of directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part 
exempt from the provisions of this clause. 
(ii) The company‘s lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable and bonuses declared 
from time to time in respect of such shares. 
10. The company may sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit, any shares on which the company 
has a lien: 
Provided that no sale shall be made— 
(a) unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable; or 
(b) until the expiration of fourteen days after a notice in writing stating and demanding payment 
of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to 
the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his 
death or insolvency. 
11. (i) To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares 
sold to the purchaser thereof. 
(ii) The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer. 
(iii) The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his 
title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale. 
12. (i) The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in payment of such part 
of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable. 
(ii) The residue, if any, shall, subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the 
shares before the sale, be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale. 
Calls on shares 
13. (i) The Board may, from time to time, make calls upon the members in respect of any monies 
unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and 
not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times: 
239 
 
Provided that no call shall exceed one-fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less 
than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call. 
(ii) Each member shall, subject to receiving at least fourteen days‘ notice specifying the time or times 
and place of payment, pay to the company, at the time or times and place so specified, the amount called 
on his shares. 
(iii) A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Board. 
14. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board 
authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments. 
15. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
16. (i) If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment 
thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest thereon from the day appointed for 
payment thereof to the time of actual payment at ten per cent. per annum or at such lower rate, if any, as 
the Board may determine. 
(ii) The Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of any such interest wholly or in part. 
17. (i) Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed 
date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall, for the purposes 
of these regulations, be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of 
issue such sum becomes payable. 
(ii) In case of non-payment of such sum, all the relevant provisions of these regulations as to payment 
of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue 
of a call duly made and notified. 
18. The Board— 
(a) may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same, all or any part of 
the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and 
(b) upon all or any of the monies so advanced, may (until the same would, but for such advance, 
become presently payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding, unless the company in general 
meeting shall otherwise direct, twelve per cent. per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Board 
and the member paying the sum in advance. 
Transfer of shares 
19. (i) The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed by or on behalf of 
both the transferor and transferee. 
(ii) The transferor shall be deemed to remain a holder of the share until the name of the transferee is 
entered in the register of members in respect thereof. 
20. The Board may, subject to the right of appeal conferred by section 58 decline to register— 
(a) the transfer of a share, not being a fully paid share, to a person of whom they do not approve; 
or 
(b) any transfer of shares on which the company has a lien. 
21. The Board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless— 
(a) the instrument of transfer is in the form as prescribed in rules made under sub-section (1) of 
section 56; 
(b) the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates, 
and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to 
make the transfer; and 
(c) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares. 
240 
 
22. On giving not less than seven days‘ previous notice in accordance with section 91 and rules made 
thereunder, the registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Board 
may from time to time determine: 
Provided that such registration shall not be suspended for more than thirty days at any one time or for 
more than forty-five days in the aggregate in any year. 
Transmission of shares 
23. (i) On the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the member was a joint holder, and 
his nominee or nominees or legal representatives where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons 
recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares. 
(ii) Nothing in clause (i) shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect 
of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons. 
24. (i) Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or insolvency of a 
member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the 
Board and subject as hereinafter provided, elect, either— 
(a) to be registered himself as holder of the share; or 
(b) to make such transfer of the share as the deceased or insolvent member could have made. 
(ii) The Board shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as it would 
have had, if the deceased or insolvent member had transferred the share before his death or insolvency. 
25. (i) If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered as holder of the share himself, he 
shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. 
(ii) If the person aforesaid shall elect to transfer the share, he shall testify his election by executing a 
transfer of the share. 
(iii) All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these regulations relating to the right to transfer 
and the registration of transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as 
if the death or insolvency of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed 
by that member. 
26. A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or insolvency of the holder shall be 
entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the 
registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of 
the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings 
of the company: 
Provided that the Board may, at any time, give notice requiring any such person to elect either to be 
registered himself or to transfer the share, and if the notice is not complied with within ninety days, the 
Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of 
the share, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. 
27. In case of a One Person Company— 
(i) on the death of the sole member, the person nominated by such member shall be the person 
recognised by the company as having title to all the shares of the member; 
(ii) the nominee on becoming entitled to such shares in case of the member‘s death shall be 
informed of such event by the Board of the company;

together with any interest which may have accrued.

(ii) The liability of such person shall cease if and when the company shall have received payment in 
full of all such monies in respect of the shares.

subject to the same regulations under which, the shares from which the stock arose might before the 
conversion have been transferred, or as near thereto as circumstances admit:

so, however, that such minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares from which the 
stock arose. 
(b) the holders of stock shall, according to the amount of stock held by them, have the same 
rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends, voting at meetings of the company, and other 
matters, as if they held the shares from which the stock arose; but no such privilege or advantage 
(except participation in the dividends and profits of the company and in the assets on winding up)

privilege or advantage.

SCHEDULE II 
(See section 123) 
USEFUL LIVES TO COMPUTE DEPRECIATION 
PART ‗A‘ 
1. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. 
The depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted for cost, less its 
residual value. The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for 
use by an entity, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by 
the entity. 
2. For the purpose of this Schedule, the term depreciation includes amortisation. 
3. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of paragraph 1,— 
(i) In case of such class of companies, as may be prescribed and whose financial statements 
comply with the accounting standards prescribed for such class of companies under section 133 the 
useful life of an asset shall not normally be different from the useful life and the residual value shall 
not be different from that as indicated in Part C, provided that if such a company uses a useful life or 
residual value which is different from the useful life or residual value indicated therein, it shall 
disclose the justification for the same. 
(ii) In respect of other companies the useful life of an asset shall not be longer than the useful life 
and the residual value shall not be higher than that prescribed in Part C. 
(iii) For intangible assets, the provisions of the Accounting Standards mentioned under sub-para 
(i) or (ii), as applicable, shall apply. 
PART ‗B‘ 
4. The useful life or residual value of any specific asset, as notified for accounting purposes by a 
Regulatory Authority constituted under an Act of Parliament or by the Central Government shall be 
applied in calculating the depreciation to be provided for such asset irrespective of the requirements of 
this Schedule.

Notes.— 
1. "Factory buildings" does not include offices, godowns, staff quarters. 
2. Where, during any financial year, any addition has been made to any asset, or where any asset has 
been sold, discarded, demolished or destroyed, the depreciation on such assets shall be calculated on a pro 
rata basis from the date of such addition or, as the case may be, up to the date on which such asset has 
been sold, discarded, demolished or destroyed. 
3. The following information shall also be disclosed in the accounts, namely:— 
(i) depreciation methods used; and 
259 
 
(ii) the useful lives of the assets for computing depreciation, if they are different from the life 
specified in the Schedule. 
4. Useful life specified in Part C of the Schedule is for whole of the asset. Where cost of a part of the 
asset is significant to total cost of the asset and useful life of that part is different from the useful life of 
the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part shall be determined separately. 
5. Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual 
value. Ordinarily, the residual value of an asset is often insignificant but it should generally be not more 
than 5% of the original cost of the asset. 
6. The useful lives of assets working on shift basis have been specified in the Schedule based on their 
single shift working. Except for assets in respect of which no extra shift depreciation is permitted 
(indicated by NESD in Part C above), if an asset is used for any time during the year for double shift, the 
depreciation will increase by 50% for that period and in case of the triple shift the depreciation shall be 
calculated on the basis of 100% for that period. 
7. From the date this Schedule comes into effect, the carrying amount of the asset as on that date— 
(a) shall be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset as per this Schedule; 
(b) after retaining the residual value, shall be recognised in the opening balance of retained 
earnings where the remaining useful life of an asset is nil. 
8. ‗‗Continuous process plant‘‘ means a plant which is required and designed to operate for twenty-
four hours a day.
